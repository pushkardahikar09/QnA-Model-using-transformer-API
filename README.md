📌 QnA Model Using Hugging Face Transformer API

📖 Project Overview

This project implements a Question Answering (QnA) system using a Hugging Face pre-trained Transformer model.
The system is designed so that a fixed context is embedded in the code, while users can ask multiple questions at runtime through a continuous interaction loop.

The model extracts precise answers from the given context using deep learning-based natural language understanding.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Uses Hugging Face pre-trained DistilBERT model

✅ Continuous QnA loop (ask unlimited questions)

✅ Runtime user interaction

✅ Clean and optimized output formatting

✅ Simple and interview-ready implementation

🧠 Model Used

Model Name: distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad

Type: Pre-trained Transformer
